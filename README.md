# Mini Thread 2.10.x Documentation

Mini Thread is a library for creating safe tasks, queues and other useful things for the esp32, in c ++. All in the background of a more secure and consistent workflow. 
So that your application will be smaller and more effective.

Many of the standard STL containers are replaced with their own optimized versions. Recognizable by its own namespace mn.
All containers, such as vector, map, list, array, can be found in the namespace mn::container.

Various types of association classes are provided for simplicity. This is just the exchange of the used allocator from the system to the Spiram allocator, whereby certain regions can be swapped out to a different storage capacity without having to rewrite the entire program. 
Certain allocation in addition to a limit, the bytes used to be limited.
All allocator find you under the namespace mn::memory.

The containers and pointers use as default the mn::memory::default_allocator_t.

The code is licensed under the GPLv3, so you always have access to it. You can also create as many derivative works as you want. However, in order for your code to get back into the official codebase, you must provide a copyright assignment for that code.

1. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a 
   build.
2. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, this includes new environment 
   variables, exposed ports, useful file locations and container parameters.
3. Increase the version numbers in any examples files and the README.md to the new version that this
   Pull Request would represent. The versioning scheme we use is [SemVer](http://semver.org/).  
4. You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of two other developers, or if you 
   do not have permission to do that, you may request the second reviewer to merge it for you.
